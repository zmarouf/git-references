# Git References

The stuff in this repo is information I refer to when I'm using Git and my mind blanks out on how to do something specific.

I make no claims that the material will be useful for anyone besides me. Explanations are not thorough, and I don't include the basic commands that I never forget.

If you're new to Git, seek instruction elsewhere!
